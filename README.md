  Technologies: React, Node.js, Express, Oracle DB, ethers.js, Web3, Docker, Vite, Git
  
  This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, blockchain technologies, and agile project management.

###### Web3  

###### Master Final Project

- **Olive Oil Supply Chain Traceability**
  #Blockchain-based traceability system for olive oil production and distribution
  

  
  Developed a decentralized application (dApp) for tracking and verifying the entire olive oil supply chain process, from production to retail distribution, using blockchain technology.

  Key Achievements:
  ‚Ä¢ Built a responsive Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS for an intuitive user interface
  ‚Ä¢ Implemented smart contracts using Solidity for transparent supply chain management
  ‚Ä¢ Integrated QR code scanning functionality for product verification
  ‚Ä¢ Created an interactive map system using Leaflet for supply chain visualization
  ‚Ä¢ Deployed the frontend on Vercel for global accessibility
  ‚Ä¢ Implemented role-based access control for different supply chain participants
  
  Technologies: Next.js, TypeScript, Solidity, Ethers.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet Maps, QR Code Integration, Vercel
